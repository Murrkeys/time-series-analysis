On 26 May 2015, a paper published in the BMJ was the first to quantify the risk associated with taking combined birth control pills and received substantial media attention worldwide.  The objective of this report is to explore and quantify the impact of the media attention surrounding the publication of the above study on the dispensing of both the combined and progestogen-only pill.  

The final report is included in PDF format, as well as the R script used for the analysis.
